1. Set Up a Virtual Environment:

In the root of your project, run: >>>>>>> python -m venv venv

activate the environment >>>>>> venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install Required Packages:

Decide on packages for essential functionalities. For example:


       1.pip install beautifulsoup4
       2.pip install openai
       3.pip install requests
       4.pip install sqlalchemy alembic

       ALL AT ONCE >>>>> pip install beautifulsoup4 openai requests

       When you want to see if something is instaled ###### python -m pip show requests  

Store dependencies by running:
>>>>> pip freeze > requirements.txt


3. Set Up Your src Folder:

Create a main entry file in src (e.g., main.py) to run or test your code.
For example, you might import and run something from Logic or initialize the database.


4. Configure Alembic for Migrations:

In the root directory, initialize Alembic:
bash # alembic init alembic

5. Create a .env File (Optional):
   Store sensitive information like database URLs in .env and load them in main.py with dotenv.


6. ????? is it possible to automatically update the file each time a package is successfully installed   

  >>>> Yes but there is need to create a custom script to do this.

7. Create a migration.py which automatically checks all the entity files and create 
   a database table for the entities that do not have a table.   /src/migrations.py
   

8. Create a db.py file ( src/db.py) that will initiate the connection to the database as 
   defined in the .env file.

   For the db.py file to be able to get details from the .env file you should install

   * pip install dotenv >>>>> pip install python-dotenv

   * followed by >>>>> pip show python-dotenv

    
   Restart the the project ( Close / ) 


9.  Set up the db_test.py (src/db_test.py) , also ensure that  >>> pip install psycopg2 , is installed
     then run >>>> python src/db_test.py
     result should be "Database connection successful!" 


10. Now that you have the 
         .env folder
         Logic Files for , user  ( You need to add the data required for the _init_py files also)
         Entity Files for , user ( You need to add the data required for the _init_py files also)
         db.py file 
         migration.py 

         1. __init__.py should be in each of the 3 main folders (LET)
         Initialize the Project as a Python Package:

         Create an __init__.py file in each folder (Logic, Entities, Tables, and src). 
         This file can be empty or contain package metadata.


12. #### Run the migration.py (src/,igration.py) file


There was an issue running the migratio.py file which is in src folder, the issue had to 
     to do with the fact that the migration.py file was failing to import "from Entities import *"  so 
     I added the lines below to the top of the migration.py file.


      *****************************************************************
      import sys
      import os

      # Add the project root directory (Base_Two) to the Python path
      sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
      *****************************************************************

13.   Database Connection Test --- > >>>> python src/db_test.py
      To test the database connection


14.   Always update the list of installed packages
      >>>>>>   pip freeze > requirements.txt
      
           

      


14. The above should be a standard template to begin a FlexPy Project.
